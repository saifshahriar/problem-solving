1. Design a class named Rectangle that represents a rectangle. The class should
   have private attributes for the length and width of the rectangle. Implement
   public methods to calculate and return the area and perimeter of the
   rectangle. Create an **object of this class**, **set the length and width**,
   and **display the area and perimeter.**
2. Design a class named Student that stores information about a student's name,
   roll number, and marks in three subjects. Implement methods to calculate the
   total marks and average marks. Create two objects for this class, set the
   values, and display the studentsâ€™ details along with the total and average
   marks.
3. Design a class named Circle that represents a circle. The class should have
   private attribute for the radius of the circle. Implement public methods to
   calculate and return the area and circumference of the circle. Create an
   object of this class, set the radius, and display the area and circumference.
4. Design a class named **Product** to represent a product in a store.

   - The class should include private attributes for the product's name
     (**productName**), ID (**productID**), and price (**price**).
   - Implement a default constructor that initializes productName to "Unnamed",
     productID to 0, and price to 0.0, and a parameterized constructor that
     allows setting these attributes to specific values upon object creation.
   - Use a method to display the product information (**displayDetails**).
   - The class should also have a destructor that outputs a message when an
     object is destroyed.
   - In the main function, create objects using both constructors, modify the
     default object's details, and display the information for each product.

5. Develop a C++ class named Point that represents a point in a 2D coordinate
   system, with two private integer variables x and y to store the coordinates.
   The class should include a constructor that initializes these coordinates
   upon object creation and a copy constructor that allows one Point object to
   be initialized as a copy of another. Additionally, the class should provide
   getter functions to access the x and y values.
6. Create a class **Student** with attributes: name, id, and marks. Create an
   array of 10 students, input their details, and display the average marks. Add
   a function in the Student class to display details of students who scored
   above a user-given mark. Input the threshold from the user and display the
   names and marks of all such students.
7. You need to calculate the area of different shapes with the help of Area( ).
   If one integer parameter (Radius) is transferred, then it will calculate area
   of a circle. If two integer parameters (length & width) are given, then it
   will calculate the area of a rectangle. Otherwise, it will calculate the area
   of a triangle if two floating numbers (base & height) are transferred. Now
   **implement** the code for the above scenario with function overloading
   concept.
8. Create a class **Distance** with attributes feet and inches. Implement a
   non-member function addDistance() that takes two Distance objects as
   parameters, adds their values, and returns a new Distance object representing
   the sum. Display the result in the main function.
